"""Outcomes from evaluating metrics in contexts.

The :class:`Result` class is the base class for all evaluation results.
The :class:`Results` class (plural form) provides a result container with
access functions and iterators.

Plugin authors may create their own :class:`Result` subclass to
accomodate for special needs. :class:`~.context.Context` constructors
accept custom Result subclasses in the `result_cls` parameter.
