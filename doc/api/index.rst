.. module:: nagiosplugin

The :mod:`nagiosplugin` module consists of several submodules which are
discussed in detail as follows. All classes you need to write plugins are
imported directly to the nagiosplugin top-level namespace, so ::

   import nagiosplugin

should be sufficient to access the functionality.

All relevant classes are documented below in alphabetical order. Refer to the
":ref:`tutorials`" section for an introduction on how to use them for typical
use cases.
