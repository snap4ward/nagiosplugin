Development
===========

Getting the source
------------------

The source can be obtained via mercurial from
https://bitbucket.org/flyingcircus/nagiosplugin::

   hg clone https://bitbucket.org/flyingcircus/nagiosplugin


Developer build
---------------

First, create a virtualenv if not already present::

   virtualenv -p python3.4 .

If you want to use Python 2.7, specify this Python version while creating the
virtualenv::

   virtualenv -p python2.7 .

Then create a developer build::

   bin/pip install -r requirements.txt


Tests
-----

Run unit tests::

   bin/py.test

Our `build server`_ runs test against the trunk on a regular basis.

   :target: https://builds.gocept.com/job/nagiosplugin/
.. _build server: https://builds.gocept.com/job/nagiosplugin/

nagiosplugin also includes support for coverage reports. It aims at 100% test
coverage where possible. Coverage reports are automatically created on each test
run and can be found in the `htmlcov` directory.

You may run the supplied examples with the local interpreter::

   export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/src
   bin/python src/nagiosplugin/examples/check_load.py


Documentation
-------------

The documentation uses Sphinx. Build the documentation::

   make -C doc html


Release builds
--------------

To create a source distribution, run::

   bin/python setup.py sdist

To create a wheel, run::

   bin/python setup.py bdist_wheel


How to release
--------------

* Ensure that all relevant changes are mentioned in `HISTORY.txt`.
* Use `bin/bumpversion major|minor|patch` to update and tag the new version.
* Follow the instructions in the official `packaging guide`_ to upload a
  package.
* Upload docs using `bin/python setup.py upload_docs`.

`nagiosplugin` tries to obey the semantic version numbering specification
published on SemVer_ but adapts it a little bit to be `PEP 386`_ compliant.
